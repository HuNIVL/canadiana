"Although the BBFC was content that the film Crash was acceptable for viewing by adults, the increasing barrage of charges against the film - that it was obscene, dangerous, likely to incite car crashes, offensive to the disabled - led the BBFC to seek expert advice. A QC was engaged to give a legal opinion as to whether the film was likely to be obscene within the meaning of the Obscene Publications Act. He concluded that the film did not offend against this law. A psychologist was asked to advise as to whether the film was likely to be dangerous or incite copycat behaviour. He concluded that, in itself, the film would have no such effect. Finally, the film was screened to a group of eleven disabled people, because it had also been suggested that the film's portrayal of some of its disabled or injured characters engaged in sexual activity could be offensive. Although the invited group did not generally enjoy the film, they concluded that its depiction of disabled people as being able to be both sexually attractive and active, (despite rather than because of their injuries), was generally a positive thing. With the combined weight of legal and psychological advice, the opinions of disabled viewers, and the unanimous view of the BBFC examiners that the film was neither harmful nor dangerous for adult audiences, Crash was classified at 18 uncut on 18 March 1997.

"The Miss Grey Cup had been an eagerly anticipated part of Grey Cup festivities since 1951. To be eligible, women had to be between 18 and 24, and the Miss portion of the title was literal: The married, divorced or widowed did not make the cut. The contest remained largely unchanged until 1988, when it slowly caught up with the times. Then, any woman over 18 was welcome to enter and cheerleader outfits were replaced with business suits. But the revamped Miss Grey Cup didn’t last long; the league scrapped it entirely in the early 1990s. As The Canadian Press reported at the time, “the Miss Grey Cup pageant has gone the way of the dodo bird.” https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/toronto/a-look-back-at-miss-grey-cup/article27514033/ ",1990,,,CAN23_E2_0004,Miss Grey Cup Pageant,,1951-01-01,beauty pageant,

"The C. W. Cross Residence was a 1912 Tudor Revival home located in Glenora. This two-storey Tudor Revival home was designed by James Henderson and built for Charles W. Cross in 1912. The Tudor Revival architecture of the Cross Residence was clearly displayed by the use of brick and half-timbered stucco walls, as well as the many tall mullioned windows. Other Tudor features included the steeply pitched roofs with overhanging eaves, high chimneys with pots, and gable-roofed dormer windows supported by decorative wooden brackets. Another notable feature of the home was the ornamental detailing along the second floor balcony. Built in the Glenora neighbourhood, the residence's original owner was Charles Wilson Cross. Cross was Alberta's first Attorney-General and an active member of the Liberal Party. The Cross family occupied the house until 1928 when Charles Cross sold the residence following his wife's death. The spacious house remained a single-family residence until the 1940s when it was divided into a number of individual suites. It continued to be used as a multifamily dwelling until 1976 when Letourneau Developments purchased the property. By then, the structure of the house had deteriorated. Despite attempts to save the residence from being demolished, a fire gutted the building in August of 1976, and it was demolished in October.",1976-08-01,,,CAN23_E1_0001,Destruction of 1912 Tudor Revival Home by fire,,1976-08-01,fire ,
