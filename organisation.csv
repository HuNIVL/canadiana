CAN23_O2_0001,,,"The modern incarnation of the Edmonton Eskimo Football Club was founded in 1949, although its predecessors date back as far as 1892, when an Edmontonian team was created in response to a challenge from Calgary and went on to win its first game. Three years later, a combined team of Edmonton and Fort Saskatchewan players won the first Alberta Rugby Football Championship. In 1908 the Edmonton Rugby Football Club was reorganized as the Esquimaux, a nickname it had acquired as early as 1897 from a Calgary sportswriter. The spelling was changed to Eskimos in 1910. In 1921, the Eskimos became the first Western Canadian football team to compete in the Grey Cup, but were defeated by the Toronto Argonauts. Following this and a subsequent loss in the 1922 Grey Cup, the Eskimos largely retreated from the football scene, making brief reappearances before being revived in 1949 as the publically-owned Edmonton Eskimo Rugby Football Club. ""Rugby"" was dropped from the name in 1952.Their first Grey Cup championship season came in 1954 under coach Frank ""Pop"" Ivy and was immediately followed by two others in the succeeding years. In 1964, the Eskimo leadership was reorganized with the establishment of a nine- (later ten-) person Board of Directors and an explicit set of guidelines to replace its original Articles of Association. From 1978 to 1982 the Eskimos won an unprecedented five championships in a row. The team continues to be a popular organization in the city, having won 13 Grey Cup championships. In June 2021, the team officially changed their name to the Edmonton Elks. https://cityarchives.edmonton.ca/edmonton-eskimos-football-club",,,Edmonton Eskimos Football Club,https://github.com/HuNIVL/canadiana/blob/main/organisation.csv,1949,football team,https://www.goelks.com/ ,This data contains an outdated term for a racialized group which may cause hurt or offence.,
CAN23_O2_0002,,,"The Montreal Alouettes (French: Les Alouettes de Montreal) are a professional Canadian football team based in Montreal, Quebec. Founded in 1946, the team has folded and been revived twice. The Alouettes compete in the East Division of the Canadian Football League (CFL) and last won the Grey Cup championship in 2010. Their home field is Percival Molson Memorial Stadium for the regular season and as of 2014 also home of their playoff games.For record-keeping purposes, the CFL considers all clubs that have played in Montreal as one franchise dating to 1946, and considers the Alouettes to have suspended operations in 1987 before returning in 1996. Canadian football has a long history in Montreal, dating to the 1850s. The Alouettes were first formed in 1946 by Canadian Football Hall of Famer Lew Hayman along with businessmen Eric Cradock and Leo Dandurand. They named themselves after ""Alouette"", a work song about plucking the feathers from a skylark, which had become a symbol of the Quebecois. The origin of the team's name also comes from the 425 Tactical Fighter Squadron, the Royal Canadian Air Force's first French Canadian squadron. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montreal_Alouettes",,,Montreal Alouettes,https://github.com/HuNIVL/canadiana/blob/main/organisation.csv,1946,football team,https://en.montrealalouettes.com/,,
