Q4733536,"A Canadian painter, artist, animator, and filmmaker from Ontario. ""In 1943, the National Film Board of Canada invited Duncan to join its Graphics Division. She worked first with the Information Display department, designing posters, publications, and travelling displays for National Film Board projects. She moved to the NFB's Animation Department when the Graphics Division was disbanded and produced her first film, Folksong Fantasy (shown at the 1951 Edinburgh International Film Festival) while under contract with the NFB as an independent producer. In 1951, Alma Duncan and her longtime partner, photographer Audrey McLaren, formed the film company Dunclaren Productions. Their first film, Kumak the Sleepy Hunter (1953) was a retelling of an Inuit legend using puppets and a stop-motion animation technique. It was nominated for a BAFTA award in 1954 as a documentary film. They produced two other films, Hearts and Soles (1955), which used the same animation techniques as Kumak, and Friendly Interchange (1959), which was made with chalk drawings. Though the production company never disbanded, it became inactive after 1960. Duncan retired from animated filmmaking in 1960 to allow herself to concentrate on her drawings and paintings, which became increasingly abstract despite taking inspiration from her natural surroundings.""

In 1949, Low was hired by the NFB as a filmmaker, and by 1950, was Head of its Animation Unit. He would work on a staggering 200+ productions at the NFB, most often as director, producer or executive producer. But more than just the number of films, Low was at the centre of so many breakthroughs in Canadian film. Low directed the first NFB production to be nominated for an Academy Award for Best Animated Short, The Romance of Transportation in Canada (1952), also the winner of a Short Film Palme d’Or at the Cannes Film Festival and a special BAFTA Award. It was a film that went against the mold of NFB animation at the time, favouring the humorous use of an “industrial animation” style, rather than McLaren’s own auteur model. Low received his second Palme d’Or for best short film at Cannes, along with another BAFTA award and Oscar nomination, for his 1957 documentary, City of Gold, on the Klondike Gold Rush. Co-directed with Wolf Koenig, it made innovative use of slow pans and zooms across archival photos, and was cited by Ken Burns as an inspiration for his own widespread use of this technique.

Q955144,"Michael John Kricfalusi (born September 9, 1955), known professionally as John K., is a Canadian illustrator, blogger, voice actor and former animator, best known for creating the animated television series The Ren & Stimpy Show. From 1989 to 1992, he was heavily involved with the first two seasons of the show in virtually every aspect of its production, including providing the voice of Ren Höek and other characters. Born in Quebec, Kricfalusi spent his early childhood in Germany and Belgium before returning to Canada at age seven. He acquired his skills largely by copying cartoons from newspapers and comic books as a child, and by studying cartoons and their production systems from the 1940s and 1950s. His main influence is Bob Clampett. After moving to Los Angeles in 1978, he collaborated with Ralph Bakshi and worked for Filmation, Hanna-Barbera, and DIC Entertainment on various shows. In 1989, Kricfalusi co-founded the animation studio Spümcø, with which he remained until its dissolution in 2005. Nickelodeon fired Kricfalusi from Ren & Stimpy due to creative differences and his failure to meet production deadlines; the show continued for three additional seasons without his involvement. Following this, he directed and produced animated television commercials and music videos for entertainers such as Björk and Tenacious D. In the late 1990s, he created the first cartoons made exclusively for the Internet: The Goddamn George Liquor Program and Weekend Pussy Hunt. He returned to television with The Ripping Friends and the adult animation spin-off Ren & Stimpy ""Adult Party Cartoon"". Since 2006, Kricfalusi has maintained a personal blog dedicated to cartoons and animation. There, he coined ""CalArts style"", a pejorative used for a widespread 2010s cartoon aesthetic. In 2018, Kricfalusi was accused by two former Spümco artists of grooming and sexually abusing them in the late 1990s, when they were teenagers. Kricfalusi released an apology for his behavior, blaming his mental health and ""poor impulse control"". He has since declared his withdrawal from the professional animation industry.

Anderson and Jay Riddle, Williams helped develop a photorealistic alien pseudopod made out of seawater, which later earned the film an Academy Award for Best Visual Effects. Continuing at ILM, Williams worked in two more breakthrough moments of CG effects that earned the company more Oscars: the T-1000 from Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991), a liquid metal robot that evolved from the work done in The Abyss; and the dinosaurs of Jurassic Park (1993), one of which was the Tyrannosaurus which Williams personally built. As the chief computer graphics animator of The Mask, Williams shared a nomination for Best Visual Effects (along with Tom Bertino, Jon Farhat and Scott Squires) at the 67th Academy Awards.[8] Williams left ILM along with Dippé following their work in Spawn (1997), which Dippé directed with Williams being the effects supervisor and second unit director.

Q3315961,"The first woman in Quebec to direct a fiction feature film, Mireille Dansereau has consistently and sensitively dealt with the problems of women living in a modern society. She has excelled in both fiction and documentary, though is perhaps most comfortable with the former, which has allowed her to craft stories based on her own experiences while emulating the style and approach of her aesthetic role model, John Cassavetes. Dansereau came to filmmaking following fifteen years in dance. After completing her university degree, she made her first short film, Moi, un jour (1967), about the alienation of a young woman who wants to leave her country. Its success enabled her to study at the Royal College of Art in London, England, where her second short film, Compromise (1968), won first prize at the Great Britain Student Film Festival. After completing her Master’s degree, Dansereau worked in various capacities – researcher, script assistant, sound recorder – before returning to Quebec where she co-founded L’Association Coopérative de Productions Audio-visuelles (ACPAV). In 1972, with minimal resources, she made the landmark La Vie rLvée, a highly personal and feminist feature that enjoyed wide release and critical acclaim in both Quebec and English Canada. The film is an episodic narrative about two women whose obsession for an older man finally leads them back to each other and away from market-driven images of female desire. Dansereau joined the National Film Board to work on the En tant que femmes series and made her first documentary, Famille et variations, in 1977. She then directed her next fiction feature, L’Arrache-coeur (1979), a sensitive and penetrating portrait of a woman’s relationship with her mother, which earned Dansereau a Genie Award nomination for her original screenplay. After leaving the NFB, she successfully adapted Marie-Claire Blais’s dark, experimental novel, Le Sourd dans la ville, in 1987. Though she has continued to work sporadically at the NFB – her most recent documentary, L’Idée noire, was released in 2000 – she prefers the freedom and flexibility afforded by independent production.

Q461827,"Paule Baillargeon. Actor, screenwriter and director (Val-d'Or, 19 July 1945 - ). Long dedicated to the social and political movements, this feminist and sovereignist is first and foremost a highly creative individual known for her intense, generous personality. Paule Baillargeon has left her mark on Quebec theatre and cinema through her acting and comedic talents, her sensitivity, her natural beauty and her hearty laugh. As a movie maker, she has created daring films that have earned a number of well-deserved awards. Originally from Abitibi, Paule Baillargeon attended boarding school run by Les Ursulines, moving on subsequently to Villa Maria and Sacré-Cœur, where she demonstrated outstanding skills in French composition. In Montréal, in 1966, she enrolled at the NATIONAL THEATRE SCHOOL OF CANADA, where she joined a group of students in refusing their diplomas three years later in protest of the institution's lack of openness to Quebec-based collective creation. In 1998, the school reinstated her and the others as alumni in recognition of their positive role in its development. In 1969, Ms. Baillargeon, along with Jocelyn Bérubé, Raymond Cloutier, Suzanne Garceau, Claude Laroche and Guy Thauvette, founded Le Grand Cirque Ordinaire, a radically innovative popular theatre focused on improvisation and collective creation that went on to mark its era with nearly a dozen different shows. Paule Baillargeon contributed to T'es pas tannée, Jeanne d'Arc (1969); La Famille transparente (1970); L'Opéra des pauvres (1973); Un prince, mon jour viendra (1974), a feminist play she co-authored with Suzanne Garceau and Luce Guilbeault; La Tragédie américaine de l'enfant prodigue (1975); and Avec Lorenzo à mes côtés (1983).

Q7660929,"Sylvia D. Hamilton, filmmaker, writer, educator (born in Beechville, NS). Sylvia Hamilton specializes in re-evaluating Canadian history and focusing on the perspectives of Black Canadians, particularly Black Canadian women. Her films include Black Mother Black Daughter (1989); the Gemini Award winner Speak It! From the Heart of Black Nova Scotia (1993); the biographical documentary Portia White: Think On Me (2000); and The Little Black School House (2007). She has received many honours and awards, including the Nova Scotia Portia White Prize, the Pierre Berton Award from the Governor General’s History Awards for Popular Media, and the Luminary Award from the Documentary Organization of Canada (DOC). Hamilton grew up in Beechville, Nova Scotia. A Black community outside Halifax, it was founded by refugees from the War of 1812. Her mother taught at segregated schools, which Hamilton attended as a child. When she finally attended a non-segregated high school, she was one of only a few Black students. She noticed that the depictions of Black people in textbooks and the media seldom reflected her experience. Hamilton became Beechville’s first high school graduate. She went on to receive a bachelor’s degree from Acadia University in 1972 and a master’s degree from Dalhousie University in 2000. In 1975, Hamilton joined Halifax’s Reel Life Film and Video Collective. (See also Film Co-operatives.) It encouraged self-representation for female filmmakers. She also worked for the secretary of state in race relations. In 1990, she co-created the New Initiatives in Film (NIF) program for the women’s unit of the National Film Board, Studio D. NIF aimed to provide accurate representations of women in the media. It also created filmmaking opportunities for Indigenous women and women of colour.

Q21825570,"Tahani Rached was born in Cairo, Egypt. In 1966 she left her native country and settled in Quebec. Wishing to become a painter, she enrolled at the École des Beaux-Arts de Montréal, but very quickly rejected the idea of withdrawing from the world to practice her craft. Life was going on all around her and she wanted to be part of it. She became involved in community action in Montreal's working class neighbourhoods, but felt unable to express the artistic side of her personality. She wanted to be involved in art and creativity, yet also convey a message. Cinema beckoned as the ideal medium of expression.

Q3610103,"After superlative undergraduate studies in literature and sociology, Terre Nash became the first recipient of a Master’s degree in communication studies from Simon Fraser University, writing her thesis on the psychological effects of videotape feedback. In 1973, she moved to Montreal to do her Ph.D. at McGill University, writing a thesis entitled ""Images of Women in NFB Films During World War II and the Postwar Years: 1939-1949."" She also conducted a year-long research project at the Allen Memorial Institute of Psychiatry on how people’s predispositions affect their evaluation of media events. Nash joined the National Film Board’s Studio D in 1975 after making a one-minute animated film called It’s No Yolk for a series of NFB shorts produced in honour of International Women’s Year. She worked for several years as a freelance writer, researcher, director and animator, before directing and editing her first major film, the anti-nuclear If You Love This Planet (1983). The film was denounced by the United States Justice Department as propaganda and went on to win an Academy Award® for Best Documentary Short Subject. Nash has made a specialty of profiling smart, politically engaged women in films such as Speaking Our Peace (1985), A Love Affair with Politics: A Portrait of Marion Dewar (1987), and the Genie Award-nominated Who’s Counting? Marilyn Waring on Sex, Lies and Global Economics (1995). She was the subject of the 1990 CBC documentary If You Love Free Speech: An Unguided Tour to the Twilight Zone, directed by Pierre Leduc.
